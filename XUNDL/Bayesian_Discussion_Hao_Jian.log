Hypothesis A: one γ emission per one proton decay.
Hypothesis B: zero γ emission per one proton decay.

The Si detectors detect 125 protons.

The Ge detectors' efficiency at 1247 keV is 5 %, so 6.25 γ counts are expected under Hypothesis A.
0 γ counts are expected under Hypothesis B.

Data = 0 because no γ counts are observed in data.

We can evaluate the probabilities of Hypotheses A and B using Bayes' theorem:

Posterior: P(A|Data)=P(Data|A)*P(A)/P(Data)
Posterior: P(B|Data)=P(Data|B)*P(B)/P(Data)

Likelihood: P(Data|A) = e^(-6.25) = 0.00193. Poisson is appropriate for counting rare events.
Likelihood: P(Data|B) = 1.0

Bayes Factor = P(Data|A)/P(Data|B) = 0.00193/1.0 = 0.00193
Priors: P(A) = P(B)

P(A|Data)/P(B|Data) = P(Data|A)*P(A)/P(Data|B)*P(B) = P(Data|A)/P(Data|B) = 0.00193
Therefore, Hypothesis B is about 518 times more likely than Hypothesis A.
The data strongly favor Hypothesis B.

Conclusion: Your analysis is mathematically sound and scientifically rigorous.
