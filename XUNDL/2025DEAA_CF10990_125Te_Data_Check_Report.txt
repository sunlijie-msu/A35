****** Data Checking Report for CF10990 from the Nuclear Data Review Group ******
The present manuscript has been reviewed for data consistency.
Below are comments that the authors may wish to consider prior to publication.


Page 1, Abstract: "level scheme has been verified and extended up to ≈5.9 MeV."
The highest observed level is at 5732.2 keV. Please consider rephrasing the statement.


Page 2, Figs. 1 and 2:
There are a total of 35 DCO ratio data points all via a quadrupole gate in Fig. 1, but 45 DCO ratio values via a quadrupole gate and 49 DCO ratio values via a dipole gate are listed in Table I.
There are a total of 18 IPDCO data points in Fig. 2, but 27 IPDCO data values are listed in Table I.
The authors may consider explaining the selection of these data points or plotting all the data points in the figures.


Page 3, Fig. 3:
All the level energies are in purple except the 5272.2, which is in red.
The authors may consider using the same color for consistency.


Page 3, Fig. 3:
All tentative gamma transitions are labeled by parentheses, while the tentative levels are not labeled.
The authors may consider labeling tentative levels.


Page 3, Fig. 3:
The 679 gamma transition from 5272.2 to 4593.2 is indicated with parentheses in Section B, but the same transition is indicated without parentheses in Section D.


Page 3, left side:
The authors state, "the experimental R(DCO) for a pure dipole transition in a quadrupole gate comes out close to 0.65(1) while that of a quadrupole transition in a quadrupole gate comes out to be 1.07(2)."
The authors may also consider clarifying the expected values for dipole gates.


Table I:
The initial level of the 328.8 gamma is 1115.9(2) 9/2-
The initial level of the 590.5 gamma is 1115.9(2) 9/2(−)
Please verify the parity.


Table I:
The initial level of the 766 gamma is 4292.2(2) 29/2(+)
The initial level of the 487.4 gamma is 4292.2(3) 29/2(+)
Please verify the uncertainty of the level energy.


Table I:
DCO of the 856.2(1) gamma: 0.98(0.16) should be written as 0.98(16) for consistency.


Table I:
IPDCO of the 834.6(1) gamma: -0.04(0.15) should be written as -0.04(15) for consistency.


Table I:
The 679.1(1), 703.7(1), 798.3(1) gammas have DCO ratios, but no multipolarities are given.
The authors may consider the possibility of assigning dipole/quadrupole characteristics.


Footnote a of Table I: "Adopted from [22]."
Ref.[22] is the Nuclear Data Sheets for A = 125 by J. Katakura, Nucl. Data Sheets 112, 495 (2011). The gamma energy values with footnote mark="a" appear to be rounded from the original values to the nearest 0.1 keV.
The authors may consider mentioning this rounding.


Table I:
The 219.8 gamma has the final level of 3693.3(4) 27/2(-).
The 544.6 gamma has the final level of 3693.3(4) 27/2-.
The 754.7 gamma has the initial level of 3693.3(4) 27/2-.
Please verify the parity.


Table I:
The 509.1 gamma has the final level of 3475.0(4) 25/2-.
The 1100.5 gamma has the initial level of 3475.0(4) 25/2(-).
Please verify the parity.


Page 8, left side:
The authors state, "The set of levels labeled P2, ..., extending this structure to a spin of 27/2+."
In Fig. 3, the highest level in P2 is labeled (27/2+).
Please be consistent in using parentheses.


Page 9, left side:
The authors state "(i) 146.6-keV transition feeding the 2028.3-keV level in C"
but E(level)=2028.6 is listed in both Table I and Fig. 3.
Please verify the level energy.


Page 9, left side:
The authors state "The presence of these transitions are further confirmed through the 690/762.2 and 394.1/896.7 double gated spectra (Panel (2) and (3) of FIG.6)."
The authors may consider using 690.2 instead of rounding to 690, in order to be consistent with the other three gamma energies which are not rounded.


Page 9, right side:
The authors state, "Structure N1 is based on the 144.8-keV isomeric state (T1/2=57.40 days) of spin 11/2−."
The authors may consider mentioning the reference for this half-life value, which is likely from the Adopted Levels of 125Te in J. Katakura, Nucl. Data Sheets 112, 495 (2011).


Page 10, left side:
The authors state, "The 2938.6-keV level is fed by the 870- 834.6- and 354.6- transitions (FIG.5 and FIG.7)."
The authors may consider using 870.0 instead of rounding to 870 for consistency.


Page 10, left side:
The authors state, "The relative intensities of the 430-keV doublet and the 537-7-keV gamma ray."
537-7-keV should be 537.7-keV.


Page 10, left side:
The authors state, "A weak 146.6-keV γ ray decays from the 2175.1-keV transition and feeds the 2028.3-keV level."
E(level)=2028.6 is listed in both Table I and Fig. 3.
Please verify the level energy.


Page 10, Table II:
For B(E2) of the first excited state in 126Te, the authors quote experimental B(E2)Down=25.4 from Ref. [28], where this value is listed as B(E2)(W.u.) in TABLE I of Ref. [28].
Also note that B(E2)Down=25.4(7) in Ref. [28] is not from their measurement but was deduced by the authors of Ref. [28] using a literature lifetime.
The most recent Evaluation for A=126 published in Nuclear Data Sheets 180, 1 (2022) gives B(E2)(W.u.)=25.1(5), which corresponds to B(E2)up=0.471(8).
Please verify the value of B(E2)up=111.9 from GBF, and also check if Ref. [29] is the correct reference for GBF.
Please consider using the same type of B(E2) values for comparison, such as B(E2)up for both cases.
Additionally, please add the unit=b for Q0 and also check Q0 values from B(E2)up.


Figs. 10, 11, 12, and 17:
All experimentally observed levels are labeled with firm Jpi, while many in Table I and Fig. 3 level scheme are labeled with tentative Jpi in parentheses.
The authors may consider adding parentheses for consistency.


Fig. 12:
The four experimentally observed levels are labeled with E(level)=1528, 1091, 642, and 444.
According to Table I, the original E(level) are 1528.1(2), 1091.6(1), 642.2(1), and 442.1(1).
Please be consistent in rounding.


Fig. 17:
The 29/2- E(level)=3913 is likely rounded from the 29/2(-) 3913.6 level in Table I.
Please be consistent in rounding.
