****** Data Checking Report for CF10919 from the Nuclear Data Review Group ******
The present manuscript has been reviewed for data consistency.
Below are comments that the authors may wish to consider prior to publication.

1) Page 5, the band-heads of band 1 (level 3542.7) and 2 (level 3702.3) are assigned (19/2)-, and later in Fig. 1 and Table I, they become (19/2-). Please ensure that parentheses and parity signs are placed consistently.

2) Page 5, the authors state that based on the present ADO measurement, the ADO ratio of 540.4 keV transition is 0.98(8), which indicates a ΔI = -1 or 1 M1/E2 character. The measured ADO ratios of the 159.6 keV and 428.2 keV transitions indicate a ΔI = 0 M1/E2 character and a ΔI = 1 M1/E2 character, respectively.
R_ADO(540.4)=0.98(8); R_ADO(159.6)=1.49(20); R_ADO(428.2)=1.20(23).

2a) In Table I, most R_ADO values around 1.6 are assigned for ΔI = 2, but R_ADO(159.6)=1.49(20) is assigned for ΔI = 0 without further clarification.

2b) Two expected scenarios, 1.6 and 0.8, for the ADO ratios were mentioned. The authors may consider providing additional clarification regarding the ratios between them.

3) Fig. 1 and Table I: the gamma-ray intensity deexciting the 1299.8 level is 100(5), while the gamma-ray intensity feeding the 1299.8 level is 81.1(41)+13.2(9)+26.2(13)=121(5). So, the 1299.8 level has Ig(out)-Ig(in) = -21(7), which appears to be nonphysical.
There is also a 576.5-keV weak gamma-ray branch deexciting the 1299.8 level with an intensity of 8.6(21). The authors report no observation of the 576.5-keV branch. However, even taking the 8.6(21) into account, the net feeding is still negative. The authors may consider checking the intensity balance.

4) Table I: Two energy values for the same state exist: 4897.2 or 4897.3, and 3789.9 or 3789.8. Please ensure that rounding is applied consistently.

5) Table I: It would be beneficial for readers if a column were included to list the multipolarities of each gamma transition.

6) Fig. 4: The authors labelled two valence neutrons: Jn1 and Jn2. It seems that n1 refers to h11/2 and n2 refers to d3/2. The authors may consider labeling them more clearly.
