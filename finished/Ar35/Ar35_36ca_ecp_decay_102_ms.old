 35AR c  1997Tr05,1995Tr02: Secondary beam of {+36}Ca produced by fragmentation 
 35AR2c  of a 300 AMeV {+40}Ca beam on a 1 g/cm{+2} {+9}Be target at GSI        
 35AR3c  Darmstadt. Fragments identified by |DE and time-of-flight (tof) from a 
 35AR4c  Multi Sampling Ionization Chamber (MUSIC) detector and two             
 35AR5c  scintillators. Measured |b-delayed Ep, Ip, E|g, I|g, |b|gp-coin.       
 35AR6c  Deduced levels for {+36}K.                                             
 35AR c  2001Lo11: {+36}Ca produced at the GANIL facility by fragmentation of   
 35AR2c  a 95 AMeV {+40}Ca beam at an average intensity of 400 enA on a rotating
 35AR3c  560 |mm natural Ni target and enhanced by a 550 |mm wedge-shaped {+9}Be
 35AR4c  degrader. {+36}Ca beam implanted into a 500 |mm silicon detector       
 35AR5c  between two silicon counters of the same thickness for detecting       
 35AR6c  |b-rays; two additional silicon counters of 500 |mm and 150 |mm        
 35AR7c  providing |DE and time-of-flight (tof); 3 large-volume (70%) germanium 
 35AR8c  detectors for detecting |g-rays. Measured |b-delayed Ep, Ip, E|g.      
 35AR9c  Deduced levels for {+36}K.                                             
 35AR c  1995Ga16: {+36}Ca produced using a radioactive ion beam from ISOLDE
