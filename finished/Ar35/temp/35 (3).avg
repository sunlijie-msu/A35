          an uncertainty no smaller than any input uncertainty and uses combined weight for
          getting the external uncertainty. It is user's decision to make the final choice.

NOTE:  Suggested adopted result is just the preference of this average code which adopts
          an uncertainty no smaller than any input uncertainty and uses combined weight for
          getting the external uncertainty. It is user's decision to make the final choice.
