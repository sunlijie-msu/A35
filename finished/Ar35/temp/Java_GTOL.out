 35AR c  1980Ew02,1979Ca15: A 600-MeV proton beam was produced from the         
 35AR2c  synchrocyclotron at CERN-ISOLDE and bombard a ScC{-2} target. The      
 35AR3c  {+45}Sc(p,8n3p) spallation reaction products diffused out of the target
 35AR4c  and reached a tungsten surface ionization source where potassium       
 35AR5c  isotopes were selectively ionized. The beam was extracted from the ion 
 35AR6c  source, separated by the ISOLDE analyzing magnet, and collected by a   
 35AR7c  mylar foil for |g-ray measurements and then a carbon foil for proton   
 35AR8c  measurements. |g rays were detected using a Ge(Li) detector. Time for  
 35AR9c  positron activities were determined using a 700-|mm thick silicon      
 35ARAc  detector. Protons were detected using a 20-|mm-700-|mm thick |DE-E     
 35ARBc  telescope of silicon surface barrier detectors with FWHM=50 keV.       
 35ARCc  Measured E|g(<5 MeV), I|g, E{-p}(>0.9 MeV), I{-p}. Deduced levels, J,  
 35ARDc  |p, decay branching ratios, log {Ift}, parent {+35}K T{-1/2}, and      
 35AREc  coefficients of the isobaric multiplet mass equation for A=36, T=2

 35AR c  2018Sa54: A 36-MeV/nucleon {+36}Ar primary beam was produced from the  
 35AR2c  K500 cyclotron at Texas A&M University. The secondary {+35}K beam was  
 35AR3c  produced via the {+1}H({+36}Ar,{+35}K)2n reaction of {+36}Ar bombarding
 35AR4c  a LN{-2}-cooled hydrogen gas target, separated by MARS, and implanted  
 35AR5c  into a 45-|mm DSSD sandwiched between a 140-|mm SSSD and a 1-mm Si-pad 
 35AR6c  detector in a pulsed-beam mode. |e+|b{++}-delayed protons were detected
 35AR7c  by the implantation detector. |g rays were detected by two HPGe        
 35AR8c  detectors. Measured E{-p}(>300 keV), I{-p}, E|g, I|g, p|g-coin,

 35AR2c  the AstroBox2 detector filled with 800-Torr P5 gas. |e+|b{++}-delayed  
 35AR3c  protons were detected by the implantation detector. |g rays were       
 35AR4c  detected by 4 Clover Ge detectors. Measured E{-p}(>100 keV), I{-p},    
 35AR5c  E|g, I|g, p|g-coin, |g|g-coin.                                         
 35AR c  1998Sc19: A polarized {+35}K beam was produced via the fragmentation of
 35AR2c  500-MeV/nucleon {+40}Ca impinging on a {+9}Be target at GSI, separated 
 35AR3c  using |DE-tof by FRS, momentum-selected by slits, and implanted into a 
 35AR4c  KBr single crystal placed in the central region of a magnet. Positrons 
 35AR5c  were detected using plastic scintillators. |g rays were detected using 
 35AR6c  a Ge detector. Measured |b-decay asymmetry and |b|g-coin. Deduced      
 35AR7c  polarization and {Ig}-factor of {+35}K ground state from |b-NMR and    
 35AR8c  {+35}K T{-1/2} from |b|g-decay time spectra.

 35AR3c  implanted into a KBr crystal. Positrons were detected using plastic    
 35AR4c  scintillators. Deduced the magnetic dipole moment and {Ig}-factor of

 35AR cG $|e+|b{++} feeding is obtained from |g intensity balance at each state,
 35AR2cG except for proton-emitting states. 1980Ew02 authors state that in      
 35AR3cG complex decay schemes of heavy nuclides this method is known to be     
 35AR4cG suspect since there is significant |g intensity that is unobserved     
 35AR5cG because it lies in a multitude of very weak |g-ray peaks. In a nucleus 
 35AR6cG as light as {+35}K the problem is less acute. They have generated a    
 35AR7cG pandemonium test in the same spirit as in 1977Ha51 and find that less  
 35AR8cG than one percent of the |g intensity from {+35}K decay should be missed
 35AR9cG for that reason.

 35AR5c  ion source. The reaction products were momentum analyzed by the Notre

 35AR cL S(A)$1973Be26 states that the differences for j=3/2 and 5/2 are small

 35AR3cL between the two allowed j values for L=2 transitions. Both C{+2}S      
 35AR4cL values are given for each level with two spin values. Assuming that all
 35AR5cL four levels have spins of 3/2 would lead to a summed L=2 C{+2}S that   
 35AR6cL exceeds the simple shell-model sum rule limit of 8 for combined        
 35AR7cL 1d{-3/2} and 1d{-5/2} pickup, which suggests that all four of these

 35AR3cL calculation in 1968Ko11 assumed neutron-well radius parameter          
 35AR4cL r{-0n}=1.15 F for d{-5/2} pickup and 1.35 F for d{-3/2} pickup,        
 35AR5cL respectively, to reproduce the forward-angle J-dependence observed in  
 35AR6cL the L=2 deuteron angular distributions. 1968Ko11 demonstrates that a   
 35AR7cL larger radius results in a larger DWBA-calculated cross section and    
 35AR8cL this gives rise to problems in extracting absolute spectroscopic       
 35AR9cL factors, and therefore, the evaluators put the C{+2}S from 1968Ko11 in 
 35ARAcL comments. 1968Ko11 states that there is some evidence that the radius  
 35ARBcL parameter corresponding to the best DWBA fit to the data might also    
 35ARCcL result in the most trustworthy value for the spectroscopic factor.
