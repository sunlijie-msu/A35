Note: 1. possible JPI presented at the end of each record line of each individual dataset is deduced only based on
         available data in the corresponding dataset, including decay data (logft or HF), L-transfer, and decaying
         and feeding gammas of each level, and so on.
      2. possible JPI presented at the end of each adopted record line is deduced by combining data from all
         individual datasets (data from the record lines only and might be incomplete since arguments only presented
         in comments haven't been considered, like shell-model calculations, analyzing power, atomic method for g.s.
         spin, and other qualitative arguments).

*** All possible JPI values are for reference purpose only and should not be taken as the final adopted assignments ***
