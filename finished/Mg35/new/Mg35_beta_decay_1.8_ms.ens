 35MG c  No decay details known. {+35}Na is expected to decay primarily to      
 35MG2c  {+34}Mg by |b{+-}n (%|b{+-}n unknown), and potentially also to {+33}Mg,
 35MG3c  {+32}Mg, {+31}Mg and {+30}Mg by %|b{+-}2n, %|b{+-}3n, %|b{+-}4n and    
 35MG4c  %|b{+-}5n modes, respectively.

 35MG cG $In |b-delayed |g-ray spectrum, 2013StZY observed one |g ray at 661 keV
 35MG2cG from the decay of {+35}Na, which was suggested either a transition from
 35MG3cG the first 2+ in {+34}Mg or from an excited state in {+35}Mg. Based on  
 35MG4cG theoretical predictions of strong delayed-neutron branches, this |g    
 35MG5cG ray most likely is from the first 2+ state in {+34}Mg
