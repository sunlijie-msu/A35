 35S  c  2015MuZY: A secondary beam {+36}S was produced via the projectile      
 35S 2c  fragmentation of a 140-MeV/nucleon {+48}Ca primary beam impinging on a 
 35S 3c  846-mg/cm{+2} {+9}Be target at the coupled cyclotron facility at NSCL, 
 35S 4c  MSU. The {+36}S nuclei were selected using the A1900 separator with an 
 35S 5c  intensity of 8.1|*10{+5} pps and a purity of 89.7%. The excited states 
 35S 6c  of {+35}S were populated by the one-neutron knockout reaction from the 
 35S 7c  {+36}S beam at 88 MeV/nucleon (midtarget energy) on a 100-mg/cm{+2}    
 35S 8c  {+9}Be secondary target located at the reaction target position of the 
 35S 9c  S800 spectrometer. The projectile-like residues were identified from   
 35S Ac  their energy loss measured by an ionization chamber located at the     
 35S Bc  focal plane of the S800 spectrometer and from their ToF measured       
 35S Cc  between two scintillators situated at the object position and at the   
 35S Dc  focal plane of the S800 spectrometer. Prompt |g rays from the          
 35S Ec  de-excitation of the {+35}S residues were detected by seven modules of 
 35S Fc  the GRETINA Ge array. Measured E|g, I|g, ({+35}S)|g-coin, |g|g-coin,
