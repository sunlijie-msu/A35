 35SI c  2012Im01: E|?5 MeV {+34}Si beam was produced by projectile             
 35SI2c  fragmentation of a 63 MeV/nucleon {+40}Ar primary beam and was         
 35SI3c  separated by the RIKEN projectile fragment separator (RIPS). Fragments 
 35SI4c  were identified event-by-event by time-of-flight between the timing    
 35SI5c  timing signals measured by a plastic scintillator and the cyclotron    
 35SI6c  rf signals. The secondary target was a 10.9 {I5} mg/cm{+2} thick       
 35SI7c  polyethylene film. Scattered protons were detected and identified with 
 35SI8c  |DE-E telescopes (FWHM=130 keV) of three layers of silicon             
 35SI9c  semiconductor detectors (SSDs) (the first one is double-sided strip    
 35SIac  detector for |DE and the other two one-sided for E). Measured
