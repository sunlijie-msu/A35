 35SI c  One-neutron knockout reaction                                          
 35SI c  2014St18: E=97.7 {I5} MeV/nucleon {+36}Si secondary beam was produced  
 35SI2c  in fragmentation of 140 MeV/nucleon {+48}Ca primary beam with a {+9}Be 
 35SI3c  production target, followed by purification in A1900 fragment separator
 35SI4c  at NSCL-MSU facility. Secondary {+9}Be target was 287 mg/cm{+2} thick. 
 35SI5c  Reaction residues were identified by an ionization chamber in the      
 35SI6c  focal plane of S800 spectrograph; time-of-flight was measured by a     
 35SI7c  plastic scintillator. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g-coin, ({+35}Si)|g-coin   
 35SI8c  using GRETINA array of Ge detectors. Deduced levels, J, |p, l-transfer 
 35SI9c  from parallel momentum distributions. Comparison with large-scale shell
 35SI9c  calculations. See also 2015St06                                        
 35SI c  2015St06: from the same group as 2014St18; analyzed parallel momentum  
 35SI2c  distribution for g.s., possibly mixed with (3/2+) isomer at 973 keV.   
 35SI3c  Neutron knockout cross sections measured for g.s. and (3/2-) state at  
 35SI4c  908 keV. For experimental details, see 2014St18
