 35AL c  2025RAAA: we believe we have found 7 new transitions for 35Al and 5 new
 35AL2c  energy levels. The same is true for 35P, with 7 new transitions and 2  
 35AL3c  new energy levels. From this analysis, we are able to extract the      
 35AL4c  branching ratios and half-lives of 35Mg and 35Al.
