 35P  c  1988DuZS, 1986Du07, 1988DuZT: {+35}Si produced by fragmentation of     
 35P 2c  {+40}Ar beam of 2x10{+11} particles/s at 60 MeV/nucleon on a 190       
 35P 3c  mg/cm{+2} Be target at GANIL. Decay observed with a 1 mm thick plastic 
 35P 4c  scintillator and a 174 cm{+3} intrinsic Ge detector (1.2% absolute     
 35P 5c  efficiency at 1.33 MeV). Measured |b|g(t), E|g, E|g. Deduced levels,   
 35P 6c  J|p, T{-1/2}.                                                          
 35P  d  1987DuZU: abstract of 1988DuZT paper                                   
 35P  c  2007Ne14: measured ground state g-factor using the |b-NMR method.      
 35P  cB IB$ From 1988DuZS, except that these are given here as upper limits    
 35P 2cB only, since the decay scheme is considered as incomplete in view of    
 35P 3cB large Q value and the possibility of missing transitions from higher   
 35P 4cB levels                                                                 
 35P  cG E,RI$ From 1986Du07, unless otherwise noted.                           
 35P  cG E(A)$ Unplaced |g ray in 1986Du07 and 1988DuZS. The placement is       
 35P 2cG from |g ray of the same energies observed in 2008Wi09 in               
 35P 3cG {+208}Pb({+36}S,X|g)                                                   
 35P  cG E(B)$ Placement from 1988DuZS. In 1988DuZT, this |g was placed from a  
 35P 2cG 6095.8 (there is a legibility problem in this report as the level may  
 35P 3cG be read as 6035.8, as seems to have been done in 1990En08 evaluation). 
 35P 4cG However, in view of in-beam results from 2008Wi09, 1994.8|g most likely
 35P 5cG deexcites a 4381 level, not a 6095 level                               
 35P  cL $With three |g-rays unplaced, large Q(|b{+-})Value of 10.5 MeV, there  
 35P 2cL could additional transitions to levels up to 5.6 MeV and the level     
 35P 3cL scheme could be incomplete.
