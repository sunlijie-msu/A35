 33P  d  Main revision in July 2017 update is removal of gamma-normalization    
 33P 2d  factor, based on communication with R. Lica (HH-NIPNE, Bucharest and   
 33P 3d  CERN) in April 2017 (see also 2017LiZZ: priv. comm.). Consequently |b  
 33P 4d  feedings and log| {Ift} values have also been omitted.                 
 33P  c  1973Go33 (also 1972Go09): {+33}Si was produced in {+18}O({+18}O,2pn)   
 33P 2c  reaction at E({+18}O)=42 MeV, bombarding a 3 mg/cm{+2} Ta{-2}O{-5}     
 33P 3c  target, enriched to 99% in {+18}O at BNL. The target was then          
 33P 4c  transferred to a remotely located counting station. |g rays were       
 33P 5c  detected with a 7.6 cm diameter by 5.1 cm deep Ne 102 detector and a 60
 33P 6c  cm{+3} Ge(Li) detector. Measured E|g, I|g. Deduced levels.             
 33P  c  2002Mo29: {+33}Mg and {+33}Al produced by projectile fragmentation of  
 33P 2c  140 MeV/nucleon {+40}Ar{+18+} in a 1455 mg/cm{+2} {+9}Be target using  
 33P 3c  new Coupled Cyclotron Facility at NSCL. A double-sided silicon strip   
 33P 4c  detector (DSSD) was used as a monitor of |b-decay activity and two HPGe
 33P 5c  counters for detecting |g-rays, FWHM=3.5 keV at 1.33 MeV. Measured E|g,
 33P 6c  I|g, T{-1/2}. Deduced levels.                                          
 33P  c  2002Mo29 give the absolute intensity of the 1847.5 |g-ray as 5.1% {I5} 
 33P 2c  in equilibrium with {+33}Al decay, but it is not clear how this        
 33P 3c  intensity was obtained.

 33P  cN NR$In March 2011 update (and in 2011Ch49, Nuclear Data Sheets          
 33P 2cN publication), gamma normalization factor of 0.051 {I5} was used from   
 33P 3cN 2002Mo29, who stated that the absolute intensity of the 1847.5 |g-ray  
 33P 4cN as 5.1% {I5} in equilibrium with {+33}Al decay. But this normalization 
 33P 5cN factor is now rejected as there are no details available as to how the 
 33P 6cN absolute intensity was obtained. Communication with the authors at     
 33P 7cN NSCL-MSU in April 2017 (by B. Singh) did not produce any clarification 
 33P 8cN of this issue. Furthermore, 2017LiZZ (priv. comm.), from their on-going
 33P 9cN work at CERN-ISOLDE facility suggest a preliminary value for absolute  
 33P acN I|g(1847|g)=78% {I16} and nearly zero |b feeding to the g.s., implying 
 33P bcN gamma-normalization factor of 0.78 {I16}
