 35CL c  1977Pa29: E=14.1 MeV neutron beam produced in the Brown University     
 35CL2c  neutron generator via the {+3}H(d,n){+4}He reaction at an average      
 35CL3c  rate of 10{+9} neutrons per second into 4|p sr. Argon target in the    
 35CL4c  form of a gas cell filled with {+36}Ar enriched to 99.8% with the      
 35CL5c  target thickness of 2.85 mg/cm{+2}. Detectors: a time-of-flight        
 35CL6c  counter telescope of two proportional counters and a NaI(Tl) crystal.  
 35CL7c  Measured |s(E{-d},|q). Deduced levels, L, spectroscopic factors from   
 35CL8c  the DWBA analysis.
