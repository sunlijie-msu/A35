 35NA c  2014Do05: E=236 MeV/nucleon {+36}Mg beam produced by fragmentation of  
 35NA2c  345 MeV/nucleon {+48}Ca primary beam on a {+9}Be target at the         
 35NA3c  RIBF-RIKEN facility. The {+36}Mg was separated by BigRIPS fragment     
 35NA4c  separator using B|r-|DE-B|r method. The secondary reaction targets     
 35NA5c  were 2.54 g/cm{+2} thick carbon and 2.13 g/cm{+2} thick CH{-2}         
 35NA6c  polyethylene. Gamma rays were detected using DALI2 array of 186        
 35NA7c  large NaI(Tl) detectors. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g-coin. Deduced levels,
