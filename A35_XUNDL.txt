 35NE c  2022Ah02 (also 2019Ah07): E({+48}Ca)=345 MeV/nucleon beam from RIBF    
 35NE2c  accelerator complex at RIKEN. Projectile fragments were separated and  
 35NE3c  identified in flight using the large-acceptance two-stage separator    
 35NE4c  BigRIPS spectrometer by tof-B|p-|DE method. The time-of-flight (tof)

 35NE6c  intermediate and final foci of the second stage of the BigRIPS

 35P  c  The secondary beam {+36}S was produced via fragmentation of a 140      
 35P 2c  MeV/nucleon {+48}Ca primary beam at the coupled cyclotron facility at  
 35P 3c  NSCL. {+48}Ca beam impinged on a 846 mg/cm{+2} {+9}Be target. The      
 35P 4c  {+36}S nuclei were selected with A1900 separator yielding a 89.7%      
 35P 5c  purity. The constituents in the projectile beam were identified by

 35P dc  plane of the S800 spectrometer. Seven modules of the GRETINA array
