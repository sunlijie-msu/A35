## 2025-04-18
- Updated Ar35_ec_decay_175_ms.ens file with E(p) values from 2019ChZU measurements
- Added E(level) calculations derived from E(p) center-of-mass energies

- Added detailed cG comment lines explaining the pandemonium effect assessment by 1980Ew02
- Clarified that according to 1980Ew02, less than one percent of gamma intensity from 35K decay would be missed due to pandemonium effect

## 2025-04-17
- Inserted new 35AR cG $ line with “pandemonium test” statement above 35AR cG E,RI$ in Ar35_ec_decay_175_ms.ens
