# Change Log for ENSDF Edits

## 2025-04-18
- Updated Ar35_ec_decay_175_ms.ens file with E(p) values from 2019ChZU measurements
- Added E(level) calculations derived from E(p) center-of-mass energies
- Added detailed level comments showing E(p){-c.m.} values for proton-unbound states
- Calculated weighted average E(level) values for levels with multiple E(p) measurements
- Added explanations for E(level) derivations using S(p) and reference energies
- Updated Ar35_ec_decay_175_ms.ens file with pandemonium test results and explanations in comment section
- Added detailed cG comment lines explaining the pandemonium effect assessment by 1980Ew02
- Clarified that according to 1980Ew02, less than one percent of gamma intensity from 35K decay would be missed due to pandemonium effect

## 2025-04-17
- Inserted new 35AR cG $ line with “pandemonium test” statement above 35AR cG E,RI$ in Ar35_ec_decay_175_ms.ens
- Corrected placement of the pandemonium test comment as requested
- Revised copilot-instructions.md to clarify N record column positions and to never reference the 1998Sc19 PDF
- Ran dataset ENSDF file through Format Check, BrIcc (conversion coefficients, S G records, CC fields), GLSC (level fitting, intensity balance, normalization, TI), and BetaShape (IB, IE, log ft, EAV, KLM capture); incorporated their outputs

## 2025-04-15
- Fixed the BR value positioning (column 32) in d:\X\ND\Files\A35\finished\Ar35\new\Ar35_36ca_ecp_decay_100.9_ms.ens
- Updated NR value to 1.85±0.04 from proper error propagation of BR=0.541±0.012
- Modified NR comment to "From 100/%|e+|b{++}p"
- Updated copilot-instructions.md with column positioning requirements

## 2025-04-14
- Deleted all "35ARS E EAV=" lines from d:\X\ND\Files\A35\finished\Ar35\new\Ar35_ec_decay_178_ms.ens
- Formatted {+1}H({+36}Ar,{+35}K)2n reaction in ENSDF notation in 2018Sa54 reference
- Formatted {+36}Ar({+9}Be,{+10}Li){+35}K reaction in ENSDF notation in 2006Me04 reference
- Added concise 1998Sc19 reference comment describing {+35}K polarization and g-factor measurements
- Updated copilot-instructions.md with rule about not modifying first/last line indentation
- Fixed spelling and formatting errors in various reference comments
