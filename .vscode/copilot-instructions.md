# Copilot Instructions

## Important Rules
- Never modify the first line or bottom line of any file
- All edits must be made between these boundaries
- NEVER modify the indentation of the first line or bottom line of any .ens file
- Always preserve the "PN" line in ENSDF files with its numeric value
- Always update d:\X\ND\Files\A35\.vscode\change.log after making significant changes

## ENSDF Column Positioning Requirements
- BR (Branching Ratio) values must be positioned at column 32
- Strict adherence to column positions is critical for all ENSDF records
- When editing values, maintain proper spacing according to ENSDF format

## Formatting Guidelines for ENSDF Files

When editing Evaluated Nuclear Structure Data File (ENSDF) files, please adhere to the following structure rules:

### Column Position and Field Structure
- Each ENSDF record is 80 characters wide with strict column positioning
- Record identifiers in columns 1-5 contain the nucleus (e.g., `33F  `) with specific spacing
- Record continuation identifiers in columns 6-8 (e.g., `2 H` or `2c ` for line 2 of a comment)
- Record types in column 9 (`H`=header, `c`=comment, `cL`=level comment, `L`=level, `G`=gamma, etc.)
- Data fields in columns 10-80 with precise fixed-width column positions

### Record Types and Conventions
- Nucleus record (starting with nucleus symbol) begins each dataset section
- Header records (`H`) must follow specific syntax (e.g., `TYP=FUL$AUT=...`)
- Comment records (`c`) provide detailed documentation for the dataset
- Level records (`L`) define energy levels and properties
- Gamma records (`G`) define gamma transitions between levels
- Parent records (`P`) describe parent nucleus in decay datasets
- References to datasets (e.g., `XREF=ABCDEF`) follow specific formatting rules

### Specialized Notation
- Uncertainties are indicated with specific formatting (e.g., `90.3 MS   10` for 90.3 Â± 1.0 ms)
- Special characters like `|g` (gamma), `|b` (beta), `|p` (parity), `|s` (sigma), etc.
- References indicated with year and author code (e.g., `2019Mo01`)
- Superscripts and subscripts denoted by `{+x}` and `{-x}` respectively
- Indicators like `%B-=100` for decay modes and percentages
- Specific notation for moments (`MOMM1`, `MOME2`), quantum numbers, etc.

### Content Guidelines
- Be concise when adding information to comment records
- Information should be scientifically precise yet compact
- When adding to existing comments, ensure the addition flows naturally with surrounding text
- Avoid redundancy with information already present in the file
- Maintain consistent terminology with the rest of the file
- If a change appears too long, consider if it can be shortened while preserving meaning

### Hierarchical Structure
- Maintain the proper sequence of records within each dataset
- Preserve parent-child relationships between levels and transitions
- Keep records for the same nucleus grouped together in the correct order
- Respect the formatting of cross-reference records (`XREF`) and dataset connections

### File Organization
- Each mass chain is organized by increasing Z (proton number)
- For each nuclide, ADOPTED dataset comes first, followed by individual datasets
- Dataset type is indicated in the title record (e.g., `ADOPTED LEVELS, GAMMAS`)

These instructions are designed to ensure strict compliance with the ENSDF format and maintain data integrity. Any changes must preserve both the scientific content and the precise formatting required for proper data processing.
