 35   c  ABST$Experimental nuclear structure and decay data are evaluated for 10
 35  2c  known nuclides of mass number A=35 (Na,Mg,Al,Si,P,S,Cl,Ar,K,Ca).       
 35  3c  Detailed evaluated information is presented for each reaction and decay
 35  4c  and recommended values combining all available data are provided for   
 35  5c  all spectroscopic properties of each level, |g transition, and decay   
 35  6c  radiation. This work supersedes earlier full evaluations of A=35       
 35  7c  published by 2011Ch48, 1990En08 (also 1998En04 update) and 1978En02. No
 35  8c  excited states are known in {+35}Na, {+35}Mg. No |g rays are known in  
 35  9c  {+35}K or {+35}Ca. Experimental data for {+35}Al and {+35}Si are       
 35  Ac  limited and their radioactive decay schemes seem incomplete in view of 
 35  Bc  large Q values and known excitations much below than allowed by Q      
 35  Cc  values. The {+35}S, {+35}Cl and {+35}Ar nuclides remain as the most    
 35  Dc  extensively studied from many different reactions and decays.          


 35   c  ABST$A large number of levels of astrophysical interest were discovered
 35  2c  35 2c in a high-resolution {+36}Ar(d,t){+35}Ar measurement without J,  
 35  3c  |p, or lifetimes. {+35}K %(|e+|b{++})p=0.37 {I15} for E(p)>0.9 MeV     
 35  4c  (1980Ew02). E(p)<0.9 MeV has also been observed (2018Sa54,2019ChZU) but
 35  5c  without 35 5c obtaining I(p). Many {+35}K levels discovered in {+35}Ca 
 35  6c  |e decay are unresolved. The 2p emission mechanism from {+35}K should  
 35  7c  be investigated and the existence of the intermediate state in {+34}Ar 
 35  8c  proposed by 1985Ay01 should be confirmed.                              

 35   c  CUT$Literature available up to September 30, 2025 has been consulted,  
 35  2c  with the help of the primary bibliographic source, the NSR database    
 35  3c  (2011Pr03) available at Brookhaven National Laboratory web page:       
 35  4c  www.nndc.bnl.gov/nsr/.                                                 
 35   c  COMM$The statistical analysis of |g-ray data and deduced level schemes 
 35  2c  is carried out through computer codes available at NNDC, BNL website:  
 35  3c  www.nndc.bnl.gov. The direct feedings to excited states in |b{+-} and  
 35  4c  |e decays have generally been computed from I(|g+ce) intensity balances
 35  5c  at each level; the associated log| {Ift} values are calculated using   
 35  6c  log| {Ift} code. All Q values have been adopted from 2011AuZZ, an      
 35  7c  interim mass adjustment file. These values are compared with those in  
 35  8c  the published AME-2003 (2003Au03). Static magnetic dipole and quadruple
 35  9c  moments have been adopted from 2011StZZ and 1989Ra17 when available.   
 35  Ac  Nuclear charge radii have been adopted from the update of 2004An14 by  
 35  Bc  I. Angeli, which are available on the website: http://cdfe.sinp.msu.ru.
 35  Cc  In cases where weighted averaging procedures have been used and the    
 35  Dc  number of independent measurements is small (four or less), the        
 35  Ec  assigned uncertainty is generally the higher of the two values: the one
 35  Fc  given by the averaging procedure and the lowest uncertainty quoted for 
 35  Gc  a measurement in the dataset.
