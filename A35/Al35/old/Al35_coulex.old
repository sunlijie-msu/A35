 35AL c  1999Ib01: Nuclei of interest produced by fragmentation of a 70         
 35AL2c  MeV/nucleon {+48}Ca beam from the K1200 cyclotron at the National      
 35AL3c  Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State          
 35AL4c  University on a 285 mg/cm{+2} {+9}Be target, and then the secondary    
 35AL5c  mixed-particle beam incident on a 532 mg/cm{+2} {+197}Au target. A 300 
 35AL6c  |mm Si PIN detector at the focal plane of the A1200 for identifying the
 35AL7c  secondary beam particles and a plastic phoswich detector for detecting 
 35AL8c  scattered particles in coincidence with |g-detection in an array of 38 
 35AL9c  cylindrical NaI(Tl) detectors. Measured E|g, I|g. Deduced level,       
 35ALac  transition strength.
