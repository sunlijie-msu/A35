 35AL c  One-proton knockout reaction                                           
 35AL c  2014St18: {+36}Si secondary beam at 97.7 {I5} MeV/nucleon was produced 
 35AL2c  in fragmentation of 140 MeV/nucleon {+48}Ca primary beam with a {+9}Be 
 35AL3c  production target, followed by purification in A1900 fragment separator
 35AL4c  at NSCL-MSU facility. Secondary {+9}Be target was 287 mg/cm{+2} thick. 
 35AL5c  Reaction residues were identified by an ionization chamber in the      
 35AL6c  focal plane of S800 spectrograph; time-of-flight was measured by a     
 35AL7c  plastic scintillator. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g-coin, ({+35}Al)|g-coin   
 35AL8c  using GRETINA array of Ge detectors. Deduced levels, J|p, L-transfer   
 35AL9c  from parallel momentum distributions. Comparison with large-scale shell
 35AL9c  calculations
