 35NA cL $The |b{+-}n decay mode was observed by 1983La12, but %|b{+-}n was     
 35NA2cL not deduced. According to the theoretical calculations (2003Mo09 and   
 35NA3cL 2016Ma12), almost 100% decay is through delayed-neutron branches. In   
 35NA4cL |b-delayed |g-ray spectrum, 2013StZY observed one |g ray at 661 keV    
 35NA5cL from the decay of {+35}Na, which was proposed either a transition from 
 35NA6cL the first 2+ in {+34}Mg or from an excited state in {+35}Mg. Based on  
 35NA7cL theoretical predictions of strong delayed-neutron branches, this |g    
 35NA8cL ray most likely is from the first 2+ state in {+34}Mg
