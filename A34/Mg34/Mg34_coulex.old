 34MG c  2005Ch66: Target={+209}Bi, Beam={+34}Mg.                               
 34MG2c  E({+34}Mg)=76.4 MeV/nucleon. The radioactive beam of {+34}Mg produced  
 34MG3c  by fragmentation of {+48}Ca ions by {+9}Be target followed by          
 34MG4c  separation of fragments by A1900 fragment separator at NSCL facility.  
 34MG5c  Measured E|g, I|g using an array of 24 position-sensitive trapezoidal  
 34MG6c  NaI(Tl) detectors. Deduced B(E2) for first excited 2+ state            
 34MG c  2001Iw07 (also 2002Mo35): Target=Pb, beam={+34}Mg at 44.9 MeV/nucleon. 
 34MG2c  The {+34}Mg beam obtained from fragmentation of {+40}Ar beam with a    
 34MG3c  Be target at 95 MeV/nucleon beam energy. RIKEN-RIPS facility. Beam     
 34MG4c  fragments identified using time-of-flight and energy loss techniques.  
 34MG5c  An array of 66 NaI(Tl) detectors was used.                             
 34MG c  1999Pr09 (also 2002Gl01): Target={+197}Au, beam={+34}Mg at             
 34MG2c  50 MeV/nucleon at 4|'. The {+34}Mg beam obtained from fragmentation of 
 34MG3c  80 MeV/nucleon beam of {+48}Ca with a Be target. The |g rays were      
 34MG4c  detected with a NaI(Tl) array. The {+34}Mg beam was very weak in
