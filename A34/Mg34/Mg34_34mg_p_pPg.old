 34MG c  {+34}Mg particles produced by fragmentation of {+40}Ar beam            
 34MG2c  at 94 MeV/nucleon hitting a {+181}Ta target. The fragments             
 34MG3c  were separated by RIPS fragment separator. The secondary beam          
 34MG4c  of {+34}Mg at 50 MeV/nucleon hit a liquid hydrogen target.             
 34MG5c  The reaction products and scattered particles were detected            
 34MG6c  and identified by a parallel-plate avalanche counter (PPAC) and        
 34MG7c  a silicon detector telescope. Time-of-flight method used               
 34MG8c  for atomic charge selection. The |g rays measured with an array of     
 34MG9c  146 NaI(Tl) detectors surrounding the target. Deduced mass
