 34MG c  {+34}Na nuclide produced and identified by 1978De39, 1984La03 and      
 34MG2c  1984Gu19 (all from the same group), and independently by 1979We10.     
 34MG3c  Yield measured by 1997Ha11                                             
 34MG c  No decay details known. {+34}Na also decays to {+33}Mg by |b{+-}n and  
 34MG2c  to {+32}Mg by |b{+-}2n (combined percentage=115 {I20}) (1984La03).     
 34MG3c  Thus it is possible that there is no population of g.s. or low-lying   
 34MG4c  levels of {+34}Mg from {+34}Na decay, only the unbound states above    
 34MG5c  the S(n) and S(2n) thresholds for {+34}Mg may be populated.
