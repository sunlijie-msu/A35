 34AR c  1986Al15: E=25.4 MeV, measured |s(|q), time-of-flight, DWBA analysis.  
 34AR2c  FWHM=350 keV for the most energetic neutrons. Comparisons made         
 34AR3c  between analog levels of {+34}Ar and {+34}S up to 5930 keV

 34AR c  1972Ca22: E=8.5 MeV, measured neutron spectrum by time-of-flight       
 34AR2c  and NE213 scintillation detector. Groups seen at 2090, 3290 and        
 34AR3c  4510 keV, the last being the most intense                              
 34AR c  1968Ha09: E=4.5-6.2 MeV, measured neutron spectra by time-of-flight    
 34AR2c  method. Five excited states reported at 2.10, 3.30, 3.90, 4.05 and     
 34AR3c  4.15 MeV

 34AR c  1967Mc03: E=4.9-5.6 MeV. Measured |s(|q) for neutrons. Three groups    
 34AR2c  reported at 0, 2190 {I40} and 3590 {I60} keV
