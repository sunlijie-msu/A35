 34AR c  1999Tr04 (also 1998Le45): 98% pure {+35}Ca beam produced by            
 34AR2c  fragmentation of {+40}Ca beam at 95 MeV/nucleon bombarding a Ni target 
 34AR3c  using SISSI-Alpha and LISE3 spectrometers at GANIL facility. {+35}Ca   
 34AR4c  beam was implanted into a silicon detector for detecting |b-delayed    
 34AR5c  protons, and |b-delayed two-proton decays. The implantation detector   
 34AR6c  was positioned between two silicon counters to detect |b{++} rays.     
 34AR7c  Two additional Si detectors were used for energy-loss and              
 34AR8c  time-of-flight measurements. Three large-volume Ge and two NaI(Tl)     
 34AR9c  detectors for used for |g-ray measurements. Measured |bp|g-coin, Ep,   
 34ARAc  Ip, T{-1/2}. Deduced levels, proton branches, Gamow-Teller strengths.  
 34AR c  1985Ay01: delayed two-proton decay of {+35}Ca is experimentally        
 34AR2c  studied in this work with proposed intermediate state at 6696 keV      
 34AR3c  in {+34}Ar populated by proton decay from T=5/2 IAR in {+35}K          
 34AR4c  at 9053 keV {I45}, the same level is at 9163 {I26} in 1999Tr04.        
 34AR c  S(p)({+35}K)=84.5 {I6} (2011AuZZ)                                      
 34AR c  A 6696 keV intermediate level in {+34}Ar in 1985Ay01 from              
 34AR2c  delayed 2-proton decay is not confirmed in 1999Tr04                    
 34AR c  No |b-delayed |g rays were reported by 1999Tr04, implying that         
 34AR2c  {+35}Ca decays 100% by delayed-proton emission.
