 34   c  ABST$Nuclear spectroscopic information for experimentally investigated 
 34  2c  nuclides of mass 34 (Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, Ar, K, Ca) has been 
 34  3c  evaluated. The principal sources of the Adopted Levels presented for   
 34  4c  nuclides close to the stability line are Endt's evaluations (1990En08, 
 34  5c  1978En02). The data sets for reactions and decays, including all       
 34  6c  available gamma-ray data, are based mostly on the original literature. 
 34  7c  There are no data available for the excited states in {+34}Ne and      
 34  8c  {+34}Na. The existence of the {+34}K and {+34}Ca nuclides has been     
 34  9c  searched and reported in a secondary publication but no evidence was   
 34  Ac  found for their detection. Both nuclides are possible candidates for   
 34  Bc  one or two-proton emission. Only upper limits of half-lives have been  
 34  Cc  proposed based on expected cross sections. Decay schemes for the |b    
 34  Dc  decays of {+34}Ne, {+34}Na, {+34}Mg, and {+34}Si are not known.  Very  
 34  Ec  little information is available for |b-delayed neutron decays of       
 34  Fc  {+35}Na, {+35}Mg and {+35}Si which lead to population of levels in     
 34  Gc  A=34 nuclides. Neutron-rich nuclides in this mass region are relevant  
 34  Hc  to "island of inversion'.

 34   c  COMM$The statistical analysis of |g-ray data and deduced level schemes 
 34  2c  is carried out through computer codes available at NNDC, BNL website:  
 34  3c  www.nndc.bnl.gov. The direct feedings to excited states in |b{+-} and  
 34  4c  |e decays have generally been computed from I(|g+ce) intensity         
 34  5c  balances at each level; the associated log| {Ift} values are           
 34  6c  calculated using log| {Ift} code. All Q values have been adopted from  
 34  7c  2011AuZZ and compared with those in 2003Au03. Theoretical conversion   
 34  8c  coefficients are from BrIcc code: v2.2b (20-Jan-2009) (2008Ki07) with  
 34  9c  "Frozen Orbitals" approximation, and with implicit uncertainty of      
 34  xc  1.4%.

 34  2c  (including update 1998En04), 1978En02 and 1973EnVA) provided an        
 34  3c  invaluable resource for the current work. The evaluators are grateful  
 34  4c  to Peter Bender (TRIUMF and SFU) and Sam Tabor (FSU) for several       
 34  5c  communications regarding their recent experimental work on the         
 34  6c  structure of {+34}P. We thank Chris Ouellet (BNL, Carleton U.) for a   
 34  7c  detailed review of this work and for many constructive comments, Libby 
 34  8c  McCutchan (BNL) for useful additional review comments and Marion
