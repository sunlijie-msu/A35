 34AL c  2001Pr08: E=68.1 MeV/nucleon {+34}Al beam produced from fragmentation  
 34AL2c  of {+48}Ca beam at 80 MeV/nucleon with a {+9}Be target at NSCL         
 34AL3c  facility. The fragments separated by A1200 separator and analyzed by   
 34AL4c  time-of-flight and energy loss information. Measured (particle)|g coin 
 34AL5c  using NaI(Tl) detector array.                                          
 34AL c  This isotope is interpreted to lie near the "island of inversion".
