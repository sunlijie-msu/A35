 34SI c  2002Mi44 (also 2002Mi48): E=55 MeV/nucleon {+34}Si beam was obtained   
 34SI2c  from fragmentation of {+36}S beam at GANIL facility, SPEG              
 34SI3c  spectrometer. Measured (fragment)|g coincidence spectra using an array 
 34SI4c  of 74 BaF{-2} detectors.                                               
 34SI c  No evidence was found for an excited 0+ state below the first 2+ state
