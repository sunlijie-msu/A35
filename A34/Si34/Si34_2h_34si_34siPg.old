 34SI c  E=38.4 MeV/nucleon. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g, |g({+34}Si) coin          
 34SI2c  using liquid deuterium target, an array of 68 NaI(Tl) detectors,       
 34SI3c  and four Si counter |DE-E telescopes, each comprised of four           
 34SI4c  ion-implanted Si detectors, in conjunction with two plastic            
 34SI5c  scintillators and a PPAC for time-of-flight information.

 34SI cG E(A)$ This |g in coin with 3326|g. This indicates that the possible    
 34SI2cG existence of the second 0+ state at 2133 keV, as suggested             
 34SI3cG by 2001Nu01 is unlikely
