 34SI c  2002En02: E=73 MeV {+35}Si beam obtained from fragmentation of         
 34SI2c  100 MeV/nucleon beam and followed by A1200 fragment separator          
 34SI3c  and S800 spectrograph at NSCL facility. Measured (fragment)|g          
 34SI4c  coincidence spectra using an array of NaI(Tl) detectors, analyzed      
 34SI5c  momentum distribution for neutron knockout from {+35}Si.               
 34SI c  Level scheme of {+34}Si proposed in 2002En02 is similar to the one in  
 34SI2c  2001Nu01. 2002En02 analyzed their |g spectrum (in coin with particles) 
 34SI3c  using as input known |g rays from 2001Nu01 in {+34}Al decay study and  
 34SI4c  matching of the envelope of their observed gamma-ray spectrum with a   
 34SI5c  NaI(Tl) detector array.
